# Excel-Coffee-Sales-Dashboard-Project
This project involves creating an interactive and visually appealing Excel dashboard to analyze and visualize coffee sales data. The goal is to provide insights into sales performance, product trends, and customer preferences using Excel features like pivot tables, charts, slicers, and conditional formatting.

Key Features:

> Sales Data Import and Cleaning:
  - Imported the raw coffee sales dataset into Excel.
  - Performed data cleaning to handle missing values, standardize formats, and remove duplicates.

> Data Preparation:
  - Organized the data into structured columns for attributes like product name, sales date, sales amount, region, customer type, etc.
  - Added calculated columns for metrics like total sales, profit margin, or sales percentage contribution.

> Pivot Tables for Analysis:
    Created pivot tables to summarize data by:
      - Product category (e.g., espresso, latte, cappuccino).
      - Regional performance (e.g., North, South, East, West).
      - Sales trends over time (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
      - Dashboard Elements:

> Sales Overview Section: 
  - Displayed total sales, total units sold, and average order value in a summary card format.
  - Top Products: Highlighted best-performing coffee products using bar charts or ranked lists.
  - Regional Performance: Visualized sales by region using a map chart or a clustered bar chart.
  - Trend Analysis: Included a line chart to show monthly or quarterly sales trends over time.

> Interactive Filters:
  - Added slicers for dynamic filtering by product category, region, or sales period.
  - Allowed users to interact with the dashboard and drill down into specific metrics.

> Conditional Formatting:
  - Highlighted key insights, such as regions with the highest or lowest sales.
  - Color gradients were used to show sales performance variations.

> Design and Layout:
  - Arranged dashboard elements for a clean and professional look.
  - Consistent fonts, colors, and spacing were used to enhance readability.

> Technologies and Skills Used:
  - Excel Functions: SUMIFS, VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP, IF, and others for calculated columns.
  - Pivot Tables and Charts: For summarizing and visualizing data.
  - Slicers and Filters: To add interactivity.
Conditional Formatting: To highlight trends and anomalies.
Design Principles: Aesthetic and functional dashboard layout.
