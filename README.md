# Excel-Coffee-Sales-Dashboard-Project
This project involves creating an interactive and visually appealing Excel dashboard to analyze and visualize coffee sales data. The goal is to provide insights into sales performance, product trends, and customer preferences using Excel features like pivot tables, charts, slicers, and conditional formatting.

Key Features:

Import the raw coffee sales dataset into Excel.
Perform data cleaning to handle missing values, standardize formats, and remove duplicates.
Data Preparation:

Organize the data into structured columns for attributes like product name, sales date, sales amount, region, customer type, etc.
Add calculated columns for metrics like total sales, profit margin, or sales percentage contribution.
Pivot Tables for Analysis:

Create pivot tables to summarize data by:

Arrange dashboard elements for a clean and professional look.
Use consistent fonts, colors, and spacing to enhance readability.
Technologies and Skills Used:

Excel Functions: SUMIFS, VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP, IF, and others for calculated columns.
Pivot Tables and Charts: For summarizing and visualizing data.
Slicers and Filters: To add interactivity.
Conditional Formatting: To highlight trends and anomalies.
Design Principles: Aesthetic and functional dashboard layout.
